    Established in 1952</h2>
  <p>In 1952, the Univerity of Connecticut was requested to establish an undergraduate program in Stamford.
    In response, the University of Connecticut, acting through the Division of University Extension, began to
    offer select courses from the College of Arts and Sciences, which also met the freshman-sophomore requirements
    of many other schools of the University. <br></p>

  </figure>
  <p>The number of courses increased over the years, allowing students to fulfill their requirements in Stamford
    instead of moving to other schools, as well as giving them the option for part-time study. The Stamford Branch
    was assisted by the Stamford Board of Education, which provided the necessary facilities and classroom space
    using Stamford High School. The professional staff of the Stamford Branch was selected by the administration
    and department heads at Storrs.<br></p>

  <p>In 1959, a plan was proposed to further expand the Stamford Branch of UConn, citing the growing student population and
    the potential benefits to the surrounding areas as reasons supporting the development of the new campus. The proposed
    campus was eventually completed in 1961 at Scofieldtown Road, with a separate library building added in 1974. Along with this change in campus,
    the Stamford Branch also expanded its academic program, now offering four-year degrees in several fields. <br></p>

  <p>In 1990, the Stamford Branch was again planned to move to a new campus, this time in downtown Stamford. In 1998,
    the relocation from the Scofield Road campus to what had been a Bloomingdale's building was completed, finishing
    the move to where UConn Stamford resides today.</p>
