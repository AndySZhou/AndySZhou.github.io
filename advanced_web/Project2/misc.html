    This guide is mostly meant as an introduction to reading SCPs, but it’s important to remember that there is an entire community surrounding it. There are numerous
    guidelines for commenting on articles, writing SCPs, site etiquette, and other facets of the community which can be found here.
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, if you’re ever having trouble understanding or reading an SCP, maybe because it’s too long, too meta, or too filled with jargon, you can check out the
    SCP Declassified Subreddit. Here, various authors post threads dedicated to picking apart some of the harder-to-understand articles piece by piece to make them as easy
    to read as possible. Some of these declasses are also in video form, and there are various Youtubers who also base their videos around a similar concept. A page with
    all of the currently declassified SCPs can be found here.
    <br>
    <br>
    The SCP Wiki is also translated into several other languages, each with their own site. The hub those sites can be found here.
