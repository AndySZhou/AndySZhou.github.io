  <h2>Object Classes</h2>
  <p>
    The standard object classes are as follows:
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Safe:</b> <br>(Almost) exactly what it says – these objects are generally safely contained and are minimal risks when contained. This
    doesn't mean that they're not dangerous at  all, just that they can be containe with relative certainty.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Euclid:</b> <br>These objects can usually be at least somewhat contained, but are more unpredictable and can throw in complications in
    the process.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Keter:</b> <br>These objects are extremely difficult for the Foundation to contain, and in some cases complete containment is practically
    impossible and the Foundation can only attempt to minimize the impact.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Apollyon:</b> <br>Used in only a few articles, this basically means it's uncontainable and humanity's doomed as a result. Doesn't
    really get used almost at all.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Thaumiel:</b> <br>The Foundation actively makes use of these objects to aid in the containment of other objects.
    This class is less common than the first three, but more common than Apollyon.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s important to note that these are not technically indicators of how dangerous an object is. A common device used to explain
    this is the “cardboard box” test: if the Foundation could leave something in a cardboard box and not have to worry about it,
    it’s Safe. So if there was a button that could be pressed to end the world (very dangerous), it would still be classified as
    Safe, because the Foundation could just lock it up and call it a day. That being said, object classes are very often <i>contextually</i>
    used as indicators of danger, and many Keter-class objects have some world-ending capabilities.
