  <h2>A Brief History</h2>
  <p>
    The SCP Foundation got its start on the /x/ board of 4chan, a board dedicated to horror writing and creepypasta. There, the
    first SCP, SCP-073 was posted. By modern SCP standards, 073 isn’t terribly interesting – it’s a statue that breaks your neck
    if you’re not looking at it. But, being the first of its kind, 073 garnered quite a lot of attention. The scary part of it
    wasn’t so much the object itself, but the implication – in this universe, there existed at least 72 other objects of a similar
    nature, and an organization dedicated to containing them. From there, more SCP’s started to pop up on the boards as people
    took to expanding on this idea, and that eventually became the SCP Wiki. <br>
    <br>
    For more on the history of the site, you can check out Roget’s “History of the Universe” essays
    <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/history-of-the-universe-hub">here.</a>

    <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    An SCP is basically an object that doesn’t obey the rules of reality as we understand them, something outside the norm. With
    the SCP Wiki having its roots in creepypasta(basically internet horror stories), most SCP articles will have a theme of horror,
    but there also exist many articles about objects that are simply strange or even benevolent. Some SCP articles aren’t even
    really about the object itself, but more about the kind of story that can be told using it.
    <br>
    <br>
    As a general rule, lower-numbered SCPs were written earlier in the site’s history, and so you may notice a change if you go
    from something like <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682">SCP-682</a> to something like, say, <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4000">SCP-4000</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some SCPs may be tangentially or directly related, but for the most part, SCPs are entirely separate, with one SCP having
    little to no relation to the next on the list. SCP’s are also (typically) written with the specific format of an official,
    scientific article in mind. Straight-up stories are instead called Tales.
