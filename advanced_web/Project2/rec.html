  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    With that out of the way, it’s time for some recommendations. The following SCPs are a mix of good starting points, highly regarded articles, and some of my
    personal favorites. I will also include some recommendations for canons and SCP-001 proposals.
    <br>
    <br>
    Note: Lower-numbered articles are generally articles that were written earlier in the site’s history, and as a result, may generally serve as better starting
    points than higher-numbered articles.
    <br>

    <h3>Starting Points:</h3>
    <h4>These articles can ease you into reading the SCP Wiki in addition to being compelling reads.</h4>

        </h4>
        <p>
          As the literal starting point for the entire SCP Wiki, SCP-173, was the original article posted to the /x/
          board, long before the current site had even been created. By modern SCP standards, it could be seen as somewhat boring, but it has the basic format and set the
          tone for the rest of the SCP Wiki.

        <p>
          SCP-682 is maybe one of the other most well-known SCPs besides 173, and one of the staples of early SCP articles.
          It can serve as a good example of the threats that Keter-class objects can pose, and also heavily features crosstesting, where the Foundation uses SCPs to test another
          SCP. Crosstesting is looked down upon by current site standards, but you may find other examples of it in some other early articles.

        </h4>
        <p>
          SCP-087 is one of the more overtly horror-focused objects on this list. It serves as a good introduction how exploration logs are used
          in articles, and maintains a good sense of mounting dread as the article progresses. It also has a very creepy picture if you scroll down.

        <p>
          SCP-1000 presents a twist on a common urban myth, taking a familiar concept and fitting it into the SCP world. It also provides a good example
          of the Foundation limiting information based on clearance level, a concept that is used in several other articles.

          SCP-2316 presents a good example of a cognitohazardous SCP, along with minor format screws and meta aspects. (Hint: Highlight parts of
          the article where it looks like there’s maybe too much white space…)

        <p>
          An early staple of the SCP Wiki, SCP-093 is a hugely influential article, having gained fame even outside of the site in the form of artwork
          and fan games. Considered “ahead of it’s time” for a Series 1 article, it is a very long read but succeeds in creating a unique sense of horror. There is also an SCP Declassified
          on it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/726cpc/scp093_red_sea_object/">here</a>.

          Similar in concept to SCP-173, but very different in execution, with a supplementary document fleshing out the full horror of the object. In addition to information about the object,
          the article also features some good character building.

          One of the 001 Proposals that takes the form of a tale as opposed to an article. Presents a well-written and compelling tale of the Foundation’s origin, framed

          In actuality, this is four SCP-001 proposals in one. The first three, “The Children”, “The Broken God”, and “Atonement”, all deal with different
          objects and could be seen as separate proposals, but “The Way It Ends”, the fourth and final part, connects them all in interesting ways, and culminates with a unique sense of existential
          dread. In particular, “The Way It All Ends” is my favorite 001 Proposal, and is extremely well-written all the way through, with good characterization and a unique spin on the creation of
          the Foundation and the Chaos Insurgency. These proposals are all also fairly long, with the fourth part being extremely long, so be warned.

        </h4>
        <p>
          A series of tales set in a universe where the Foundation is attempting to make a task force using certain sentient SCP objects. Resurrection is notable for having a much
          brighter and more humorous tone than many other SCP canons, more similar in tone to something like a Marvel movie than, say, something by Stephen King, although the horror aspects are still
          present. Warning: this canon is pretty reliant on context from older Foundation “canon”, from before the “no set canon” rule.
          <br>
          <br>
          A list of relevant articles and tales can be found at the bottom of the page, in the “Reading” tab, but the “Overview” tab can also serve as a good background-setter if you want to just jump
          right in.

        This canon deals with the aftermath of anomalies becoming public knowledge, and the Foundation becoming a public organization. It has a unique perspective, as the rest of
        the site is based in the fact that anomalies, and the Foundation, are kept secret from the public. As such, this canon explores themes and ideas that can’t be explored in other canons.
