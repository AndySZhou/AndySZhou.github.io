  <h2>Standard Format</h2>
  <p>
    SCP’s will usually consist of, at the very least, three sections: Object Class, Special Containment Procedures, and Description.
    Most SCP’s will also include an Addendum or Exploration Logs of some sort for added context or storytelling, but the first
    three are the bare minimum.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Object Class</b>: Object class is an indicator of how hard it is to contain the SCP object. They will be explained in more detail
    <a href="objectclasses.html">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Special Containment Procedures</b>: This is how, in universe, the Foundation actually contains the object and hides it from the
    public eye. Containment procedures will generally give you hints at what the object is, but will rarely tell you outright,
    and are usually based in at least some form of science or logic.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Description</b>: This section is main portion of many articles, and is the summation of what the object actually is. However, it’s
    important to note that the description is often only a basic overview, with addendums or logs adding more context, or in some
    cases, even shedding new light on the nature of the object that wasn’t present in the description.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Logs</b>: Many articles include logs of  exploration or interviews which serve to add a human element to articles and proved
    extra context. Some SCPs, such as SCP-1730, are mostly made up of logs.
    <br>
    <br>
    Many articles will also intentionally deviate or otherwise mess with the format in some way to play up certain aspects of the
    article. This will be discussed in more detail in the <a href="formatscew.html">Format Screws section.
