  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I said earlier that the SCP Wiki has no canon. This is true in the sense that there is no set storyline or sequence of events
    to the site, but there are many terms and lore aspects that are almost universally taken to be true within the “canon”. While
    many of these can still be contradicted by certain articles or tales, they are very widely agreed upon across the site, with
    most of them having their own pages.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Foundation Terminology and Lore page will give most of the basics terms that referenced the most, but some articles may include
    some more obscure concepts.
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h2>Foundation Terminology and Lore</h2>
  <p>
    <br>
    <b>Clearance:</b><br>Clearance levels refer to how high-ranking someone has to be to access certain information. Clearance in articles is
    mainly used to add a sense of secrecy to certain part of the article, although in terms of browsing the site is mostly means
    that some information put into a collapsible as a representation of clearance. An overview of clearance levels can be found
    <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/security-clearance-levels">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Amnestics:</b> <br>Chemicals that the Foundation uses to erase and manipulate memories. Often used to cover up civilian exposure to
    anomalous objects, but sometimes used for other purposes. The opposite of…
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Mnestics:</b> <br>Much less commonly used than amnestics, mnestics instead are used to recover a person’s memory or enable them to perceive
    something that could not otherwise be perceived.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Reality Benders:</b> <br>Refers to people with the ability to control and manipulate reality. Also commonly referred to as Type Greens,
    or in a colloquial context, bixbies.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>“Skip” or “scip”:</b> <br>Both in-universe and out, slang used to refer to SCPs.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Containment Breach:</b> <br>Exactly what it sounds like, this involves an SCP breaking out of containment.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>D-Class Personnel:</b> <br>Supposedly irredeemable criminals, the worst of the worst, that the Foundation uses for the purpose of testing
    the properties of SCPs as well as general fodder.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MTF:</b> <br>Mobile Task Force, groups formed by Foundation personnel, usually for the purpose of combat, exploration, or containment
    of certain SCPs. It is not generally important to know every MTF, but a list of them can be found here.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Agents and Researchers:</b> <br>Foundation employees. Agents deal with working in the field to locate and respond to SCPs and other threats,
    whereas researchers work on, well, research. A page on notable Foundation personnel can be found <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/personnel-and-character-dossier">here</a>. For general article-reading
    purposes, it is not very important to know notable personnel, but if you plan on delving into Tales or Canons, you may appreciate
    the background knowledge.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>O5 Council:</b> <br>The O5 Council is the highest authority within the Foundation, comprised of 13 members. Individual O5 Council members are referred to as O5-# (Ex. O5-1, O5-2, etc.).
    While there is no set canon to who any of the O5 Council members are or in rarer cases, whether or not they even exist, many tales involving them will use some of the
    identities provided <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/o5-command-dossier">here</a>. The O5 Council rarely make appearances in numbered SCP articles, being more utilized in tales, but there will sometimes be mentions of them,
    notes left by them, or certain portions of an article that “require” their clearance to access. They generally play a large part SCP-001 proposals, which will be explained later.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>GoI:</b> <br>Group of Interest. Refers to other groups associated with anomalous objects, like the Foundation. More on these later.
    The official GoI Hub can be found <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PoI:</b> <br>Person of Interest. The same as GoI except for a single person.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Secure Facilities:</b> <br>Foundation facilities often referred to as Site-# (Ex. Site 19). Different Sites will have different
    specialties and capabilities. It is not generally important to have to know specific sites, but a page of them can be
    found <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facilities-locations">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Cognitohazard:</b> <br>An object that is cognitohazardous is something that has a dangerous effect on anyone who perceives it. This
    can be through any of the five senses. Cognitohazards can have a variety of effects, not limited to only mental damage. Often
    go hand-in-hand with…
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Memes:</b> <br>No, not those memes. Memes in the SCP Wiki refer to ideas that self-perpetuate in anomalous ways and have anomalous
    effects. Not to be confused with…
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Infohazard:</b> <br>Unlike cognitohazards or memes, infohazards have some kind of effect if you simply know about it. Infohazards are generally objects, unlike memes which can just be pure information. For example, the SCP-426, the previously mentioned toaster, is an infohazard.
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
    <h3><b>Out-of-Universe Terminology</b>:</h3>
  <p>
    <br>
    <b>Joke SCPs:</b> <br>Separate from mainlist SCPs, these are denoted with -J following the number. These aren’t meant to be taken seriously,
    often poking fun at certain tropes common in actual SCP articles, and they can be found <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/joke-scps">here</a>. Note: Not all “funny” SCPs are
    Joke SCPs. Some mainlist SCPs have humorous elements but fit within the parameters of how an SCP is written. Joke SCPs are
    explicitly ridiculous and often parodical.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>ARC SCPs:</b> <br>SCPs are held to a fairly high standard, and many SCP articles have been deleted for not being up to the standards
    of the site or not fitting within it. ARC SCPs, or Archived SCPs, are SCPs that would have been deleted, but have some importance or significance
    to other SCP articles or Tales. A list of ARC SCPs can be found <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/archived-scps">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Canons:</b> <br>As explained before, the SCP Foundation does not have a set canon in terms of a storyline, and different Canons refer
    to different storylines written by groups of authors. These will often be mostly comprised of Tales, although some may include
    some SCP Articles as well. The Canon Hub can be found <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/canon-hub">here</a>.
