    <p>For me, time seems to vary by what place I'm in. For example, sometimes when I'm just in some empty classroom
      in a corner of the UConn building where no one can hear you scream, waiting for my next class to come and then
      be over so I can just go home already, time seems to move very slowly. Most of the time, whichever classroom that
      has the misfortune of having me in it doesn't have any windows to the outside, so the only thing I have to tell the
      time by is my phone, as I do some other homework or just surf the web and watch the time pass on by. Time moves even
      slower when I'm actually that last class of the day, and if its a lecture - especially if its a history lecture - I'm
      always feeling like time is moving slow just to spite me as I slowly go insane.</p>
    <p>Anyways, here are some pictures of the road just outside the building at different times. Click to change between them.</p>
